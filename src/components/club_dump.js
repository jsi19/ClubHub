Notably, the development and involvement in AI ethics by students and professionals has been relatively nascent. The foresight of how important it is to regulate AI through the lens of ethical discussion and implementation is of paramount significance within the setting of the rapid development of AI and how it has already permeated of our daily lives. As such, the AI Robotics Ethics Society was founded in 2018 at UCLA by Aaron Hui to promote the awareness and importance of ethical implementation/regulation of AI. AIRES achieves its mission of ensuring AI is created both ethically and responsibly through a three-pronged approach: 1. To host a series of intra- and inter-departmental discussions at universities on AI and Robotics ethics. 2. To create a network and promote such awareness through hosting discussions and conferences with chapters of the AI Robotics Ethics Society. 3. To create a small lecture series on the latest breakthroughs and achievements in AI and Robotic ethics.",

Mainly, we aim to build a community for those affected by cancer and work so that one day, no one has to hear the dreaded words 'you have cancer.' Relay for Life is a 24-hour fundraising festival held at Drake Stadium to celebrate survivors, remember those we've lost, and fight back against a disease that affects and connects us all in some way! The event includes inspiring ceremonies, our Mr. Relay Pageant, talented performers, a silent rave, and so much more. In the past five years, we raised over $1,000,000 for the American Cancer Society to fund cancer research and patient services to support those battling, making us the largest college Relay West of the Mississippi! Throughout the year, in addition to planning Relay, we also plan education rallies on Bruin Walk for various types of cancers, organize hospital visits to bring cards to patients on the Oncology floor, and host fundraising events such as comedy shows and concerts! Since our start 20 years ago, American Cancer Society On Campus has been recognized with the Leaders of Hope award three years in a row, Survivor & Caregiver Engagement Chapter of the Year three years in a row, Advocacy Chapter of the Year, and Top Fundraiser of the year.",

    description:
      "The American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) is a professional organization for chemical engineers. AIChE was established in 1908 with the purpose of establishing chemical engineers as a profession independent from chemists and mechanical engineers. The mission of the AIChE student chapter at UCLA is to promote excellence in the Chemical Engineering Department of the School of Engineering and Applied Science by providing resources and support to the undergraduate students so that they can succeed academically and advance professionally. AIChE's vision is to provide value as the global leader of the chemical engineering profession and be the lifetime center for professional and personal growth. In 1908 a small group of chemical engineers formed a professional society to promote and improve chemical engineering as a discipline. At first, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) met with strong resistance, especially from the American Chemical Society (ACS), which claimed control over all pure and applied chemistry in the United States. In response, AIChE adopted a number of conservative measures, including strict membership criteria to keep membership low and avoid competition with ACS. Nonetheless, the value of AIChE was realized by the entire discipline in 1925, when chemical engineering became the first profession to use scholastic accreditation to ensure the consistency and quality of academic chemical engineering courses. The conservative attitude paid off when peace was made between ACS and AIChE around 1930. The membership criteria were lifted and chemical engineers joined in droves. Today AIChE remains the principal chemical engineering professional society in the United States. Currently about 57,000 (~70%) of American chemical engineers are members.",

    description:
      "Judo is best known for its throwing techniques but also includes numerous techniques for controlling an opponent while on the ground. A good judoka, one who practices Judo, will first use timing and leverage to bring his opponent off balance and execute a throw, and then immobilize with grappling maneuvers or submit with arm locks and choke holds. This class will foster general fitness and well-being, and develop real-world safety and self-defense strategies, all while improving physical fitness, flexibility, strength, coordination, and agility.",

We take all skill levels: swimmers who join just for recreation to swimmers who compete at nationals. In terms of meets, we have around 2 meets per quarter. One travel meet and one home meet at Spieker (where the NCAA team competes!). All meets are optional but you are highly encouraged to represent us and compete! We will also be having free practices during Week 1 to allow you to get a feel if you would want to join us before paying. If you haven't already, please like our facebook page: UCLA Club Swimming! Dues are $70 per quarter, making us one of the cheapest club sports.",

    description:
      "OutWrite Newsmagazine is the official queer newsmagazine of the University of California, Los Angeles. OutWrite strives to build a growing educational platform through a multi-media approach that uplifts and empowers the often silenced voices of the incredibly diverse queer community. We aim to challenge dominant cisheteronormative narratives through an unapologetically anti-queerphobic, anti-racist, and progressive lens. OutWrite was established in 1979 under its original title TenPercent, becoming the first queer college publication in the country. The name TenPercent was chosen from the Alfred Kinsey’s study Sexual Behavior in the Human Male which stated that 10% of men identified as homosexual. In 2005, the newsmagazine’s staff petitioned to change the name to OutWrite to decenter the white, cis, gay male identity and use a name which better represents the queer community’s vast spectrum of identities. Throughout the years, the newsmagazine referred to itself as a 'gay and lesbian' newsmagazine, slowly adding more identities to its moniker just as the mainstream community did in the late 20th century. Our label has since been changed to 'queer' newsmagazine to recognize both the importance of inclusivity in our community and the inherent radical nature of our mission; queer is a verb and political statement as much as it is an umbrella descriptor encompassing the ever-growing LGBTQ+ acronym. OutWrite is proud to transform and adapt itself to better represent and serve queer people, changing its own identity as our community grows and changes.",

The alliance looks forwards to maintaining its commitment to respect, understanding, equity, and equality while underscoring the need for the eradication of heteronormativity, queerphobia, and cisheterosexism outside and within the community at UCLA. These goals are achieved by fostering spaces wherein community can thrive, and engaging in social programming and advocacy efforts.",
